If it does, select one of the\u00a0dice from your Miracle dice pool to substitute that\u00a0dice roll (if a roll involves more than one dice, e.g. a\u00a0Charge roll or Battle-shock test, only a single dice can\nbe substituted).

Each Miracle dice can only be selected for\u00a0substitution once. Once all Miracle dice substitutions\u00a0have been made, remove the chosen Miracle dice\u00a0from your Miracle dice pool, and roll all remaining,\u00a0unsubstituted dice that are a part of the dice roll. You\u00a0can use Miracle dice when a unit performs an Act of\u00a0Faith for any of the following types of dice roll:\n\u25a0 Advance roll\n\u25a0 Battle-shock test\n\u25a0 Charge roll\n\u25a0 Damage roll\n\u25a0 Hit roll\n\u25a0 Saving throw\n\u25a0 Wound roll", "id": "7ef7-dca6-e2ea-ecc8", "name": "Acts of Faith", "hidden": false}, {"description": "While a Bodyguard unit contains a Leader, it is known as an Attached unit and, with the exception of rules that are triggered when units are destroyed (pg 12), it is treated as a single unit for all rules purposes.
